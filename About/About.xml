This is a tool to compare stats for stuffs, for when mods add a whole bunch of new fabrics, metals, etc. and you can't remember what's the best to make things with.

Planned updates:
Make all base, factor, and offset stats selectable for display
Support for modded stuff categories

Safe to add to savegames
